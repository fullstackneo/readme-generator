In the project's directory, create a folder called dist. This stands for "distribution," which is a common name used in web development to indicate that the contents of that folder are exactly what we need for the final product. For deployment of the portfolio site, we only need the HTML and CSS files, and none of the JavaScript we used to create them. This dist folder can help use distinguish the production-ready code to deploy from the working code that gets us there.
